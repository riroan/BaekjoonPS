### 문제 설명

<p>Bucket is planning to make a very long journey across the countryside by bus. Her journey consists of <b>N</b> bus routes, numbered from 1 to <b>N</b> in the order she must take them. The buses themselves are very fast, but do not run often. The i-th bus route only runs every <b>X<sub>i</sub></b> days.</p>

<p>More specifically, she can only take the i-th bus on day <b>X<sub>i</sub></b>, 2<b>X<sub>i</sub></b>, 3<b>X<sub>i</sub></b> and so on. Since the buses are very fast, she can take multiple buses on the same day.</p>

<p>Bucket must finish her journey by day <b>D</b>, but she would like to start the journey as late as possible. What is the latest day she could take the first bus, and still finish her journey by day <b>D</b>?</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that it is possible for Bucket to finish her journey by day <b>D</b>.</p>
