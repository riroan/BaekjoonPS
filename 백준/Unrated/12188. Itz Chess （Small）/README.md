<p>For example, if there are 3 pieces King is at B2, Pawn at A1 and Queen at H8 then the total number of pieces that an be killed is 3. H8-Q can kill B2-K, A1-P can kill B2-K, B2-K can kill A1-P</p>

<p>A position on the chess board is represented as A1, A2... A8,B1.. H8</p>

<p>Pieces are represented as</p>

<ul>
	<li>(K) King can move in 8 direction by one place.</li>
	<li>(Q) Queen can move in 8 direction by any number of places, but can't overtake another piece.</li>
	<li>(R) Rook can only move vertically or horitonzally, but can't overtake another piece.</li>
	<li>(B) Bishop can only move diagonally, but can't overtake another piece.</li>
	<li>(N) Knights can move to a square that is two squares horizontally and one square vertically <strong>OR</strong> one squares horizontally and two square vertically.</li>
	<li>(P) Pawn can only kill by moving diagonally upwards (towards higher number i.e. A -> B, B->C and so on).</li>
</ul>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, <strong>T</strong>. <strong>T</strong> Test cases follow. Each test case consists of the number of pieces , <strong>N</strong>. <strong>N</strong> lines follow, each line mentions where a piece is present followed by <strong>-</strong> with the piece type</p>

<p>Limits</p>

<ul>

	<li><span style="line-height:1.6em">1 ≤ </span><strong style="line-height:1.6em">N</strong><span style="line-height:1.6em"> ≤ 10.</span></li>
	<li>Pieces can include K, P</li>
</ul>
