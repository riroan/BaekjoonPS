<p>There are <b>N</b> people numbered from 1 to <b>N</b>, standing in a queue to withdraw money from an ATM. The queue is formed in ascending order of their number. The person numbered <b>i</b> wants to withdraw amount <b>A<sub>i</sub></b>. The maximum amount a person can withdraw at a time is <b>X</b>. If they need more money than <b>X</b>, they need to go stand at the end of the queue and wait for their turn in line. A person leaves the queue once they have withdrawn the required amount.</p>

<p>You need to find the order in which all the people leave the queue.</p>
